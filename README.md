# git-basics-formation

Master git basics using conventional commits through these exercises.

## How to use

1. Fork this repository,
2. Clone the fork on your machine,
3. Follow the exercise in order (starting at exercise 1),
4. If you want to learn git, **use the command line**. Using the EDI (VSCODE, IntelliJ, Atom, CURSOR, ...) interface won't allow you to understand what's going on under the hood. **Use the command line.**
