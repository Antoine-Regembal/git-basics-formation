# Exercise 7

## Exercise statement

Your film scenario is complete. You want to see it on the `main` branch now.

- Find a way to `merge` the `feat/my-super-scenario` branch into the `main`
branch.
- Delete the local `feat/my-super-scenario` branch,
```bash
    git branch -D feat/my-super-scenario
```
- Check the git history: what is the difference between `rebase` and `merge`?
