# Exercise 4

## Exercise statement

- Check the git log history:
```bash
    git log --oneline
```

You can see that we now have two commits related to the poem (note how the two
commits share the same scope). The first creates the poem, it's a `feat` commit.
 The second one fixes the poem, it's a `fix` commit.

This is a totally valid way to correct and error.

But as you can see in the git log history, the second commit only purpose is to
fix the first one.
Now poem lovers may think you are a bad poem writer because you cannot write a
good poem on the first try!

Only if we could return to the past to make the history looking just like you
perfectly wrote the poem on the first place.

Guess what? You can.

- Delete the last commit about the poem, but keep changes:
```bash
    git reset --soft HEAD~1

    # --soft flag keeps your modifications so you can reuse them,
    # --hard delete your modifications.
```
- To modify the initial poem commit with the `Exercise 3` modifications, so the
history looks just like it was perfect on the first place, we can `amend` the
commit. Also don't forget to modify the initial commit message so it reflects
the corrections (not `Tulips` but `Roses`):
```bash
    git commit --amend

    # you will be prompted to modify the initial commit message,
    # if you want the initial commit message unchanged you can use the
    # --no-edit flag: `git commit --amend --no-edit`
```
- Check the git log history: now we have made it looks like it was correct since
the beginning. The history is clean.
- Push the changes to the remote branch.
