# Exercise 6

## Exercise statement

You want to add a dialog line to your film scenario.
But before to do that you want your `feat/my-super-scenario` branch to be up to
date with the `main` branch.

- Go back to the `feat/my-super-scenario` branch,
- Update your branch using `rebase` so it is now up to date with the `main`
 branch:
 ```bash
    git rebase origin/main

    # `git rebase` rewrites the current branch history. Never use it onto public
    # branches such as `main`, `master`, `dev` and use the `merge` technique
    # instead on these particular cases.
 ```
- Check the git log history: now the `main` branch modifications have been added
to the `feat/my-super-scenario` branch respecting the git history. This is why
when you want to update your branch you should almost always prefer to `rebase`
instead of `merge`. `merge` will not create a new commit containing all of the
updates your branch were missing and place it **after** your latest branch 
commit, not respecting the git history: this is dirty and should be avoided.
- Modify the scenario to add the dialog line at the end of the file:

```txt
"Wait! But I wanna know!"
```

- Create a commit with a meaningful commit name of your choice,
- Push the commit to the remote branch (`feat/my-super-scenario`),
```bash
    git push -f

    # The `-f` flag will force push. This is needed here because the scenario
    # branch was previously pushed with a certain history but since then in this
    # exercise we modified the branch history by updating it with the `main`
    # branch, git will ask you to confirm that the new history you are proposing
    # for this branch is correct.
```
